# Life Development Roadmap

Building genuine intelligence through conceptual understanding, metacognition, and transparent reasoning.

## 🎯 Vision

Create a sovereign intelligence system that:
- Learns concepts through teaching, not training

**What's missing:**
- ❌ Advanced inference (multi-hop, analogical)
- ❌ Learning from examples
- ❌ Natural language interface
- ❌ Web interface
- ❌ Distributed deployment

## Principles Guiding Development

1. **Simplicity first**: Intuitive before optimal
2. **Transparency always**: Every decision explainable
3. **Education over training**: Teaching not datasets
4. **Sovereignty by default**: No platform dependencies
5. **Open by design**: Apache 2.0, community-driven
